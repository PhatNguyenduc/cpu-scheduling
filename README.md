# cpu-scheduling
Tool for OS Principle  

Both tools haven't verify yet; just work with normal cases and case when cpu is free.  
Folder2 from minhq2004 - can draw Gantt chart.  

*Note*  
Priority of f1 is higher to lower  
Priority of f2 is lower  to higher  
You should check  with both tools to ensure the answer.  
Another helpful web I just know, maybe this better (300+ stars): https://process-scheduling-solver.boonsuen.com/
